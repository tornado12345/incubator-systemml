# How to invoke this pydml script PageRank.pydml?
# Assume PAGE_RANK_HOME is set to the home of the pydml script
# Assume input and output directories are on hdfs as INPUT_DIR and OUTPUT_DIR
# Assume rows = 1000 and cols = 1000 for g,  rows = 1000 and cols = 1 for p, rows = 1000 and cols = 1 for e, rows = 1 and cols = 1000 for u,
# Assume alpha = 0.85, max_iteration = 3
# hadoop jar SystemML.jar -f $PAGE_RANK_HOME/PageRank.pydml -python -args "$INPUT_DIR/g" "$INPUT_DIR/p" "$INPUT_DIR/e" "$INPUT_DIR/u" 0.85 3 "$OUPUT_DIR/w" 

G = load($1)
# dense
p = load($2)
e = load($3)
u = load($4)
alpha = $5
max_iteration = $6
i = 0

while(i < max_iteration):
    p = alpha * (dot(G, p)) + (1 - alpha) * (dot(dot(e, u), p))
    i = i + 1

save(p, $7, format="text")
